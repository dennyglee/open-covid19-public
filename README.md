# open-covid19-public
A collaboration between SCRI and Databricks on the analysis of open COVID-19 datasets.

## Goals
Childrens hospitals are asking for advice and data as their region has more cases emerge:
- how to scrub and safely distribute relevant data to other childrens hospitals
- impact of comorbidity with COVID-19 in children
- impact on quality of care under resource strain: staff, supplies, etc.
- guidelines of care are different for adults vs children, help define standards of care:
  - e.g. elective procedures are not the same for adults and children.  When is a procedure elective in children?
